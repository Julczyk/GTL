# expressions

### booleans
- `:c` := false
- `c:` := true

## ordering
- `>` := `beats`
- `<` := `beaten by`
- `=` := `is`
- `==` := `vibe with`
- `>=` := `unbeaten by`
- `<=` := `doesn't beat`

## Basic math operators
- addition: ` > X joined by Y` - `X+Y`
- multiplication: ` > X breeding like Y times` - `X*Y`
- negation: ` > the literal opposite of X` - `-X`\
**NOTICE:** Subtraction is achieved by negation and addition:\
(example: ` > X is joined by the literal opposite of Y` = `X-=Y`)
- modulo: ` > X is whatever left from Y` = `X%Y`
- inversion: ` > X flipped`\
**NOTICE:** division is achieved by multiplication and inversion:\
(example: ` > X is Y breeding like the literal opposite of Z times` = `X=Y*1/Z`= `X=Y/Z`)

## brackets
In GTL `(` and `)` are used to group expressions in a standard way.\

## Order of operations
Intuition: Standard order of operations is used in mathematical expressions.
1. Brackets
2. Comparisons:
   - NOT
   - ALSO
   - ALTERNATIVELY
3. properties:
   - the literal opposite of
   - flipped
4. Mathematical operations:
   - breeding like
   - joined by
   - whatever left from
