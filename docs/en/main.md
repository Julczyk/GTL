# GTL Documentation

Welcome to the GreenTextLang (GTL) documentation!

**Name:** Green Text Programming Language, or GTL (GreenTextLang) for short.

GTL is a multi-paradigm programming language designed so that writing code resembles creating classic internet copypastas in the format popularized by sites like 4chan and (subsequently) Reddit, or Wykop.
Although GTL is a fully functional language, its main goal is to provide fun and a unique programming experience, rather than necessarily for creating production code. Discover how simple and enjoyable coding can be when every line is the start of a new story!

## Main Property
Every line of code must start with the sequence ` > `.\
This is:
- a space
- the `>` character
- a non-zero amount of whitespace

## Hello World
A simple Hello World in GTL looks like this:
```GTL
 > spit "Hello, World!"
```
or, if we want it immediately in story form (in the main function):
```GTL
 > be me
 > spit "Hello, World!"
 > profit
```
