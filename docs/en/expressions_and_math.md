# expressions

### booleans
- `:c` := false
- `c:` := true

## ordering
- `>` := `beats`
- `<` := `beaten by`
# `=` (assignment) is `is`. For equality comparison, use `==` (`vibe with`).
- `==` := `vibe with`
- `>=` := `unbeaten by`
- `<=` := `doesn't beat`

## Basic math operators
- addition: ` > X joined by Y` - `X+Y`
- multiplication: ` > X breeding like Y times` - `X*Y`
- negation: ` > the literal opposite of X` - `-X`\
**NOTICE:** Subtraction is achieved by negation and addition:\
(example: ` > X is joined by the literal opposite of Y` = `X-=Y`)
- modulo: ` > X is whatever left from Y` = `X%Y`
- inversion: ` > X flipped`\
**NOTICE:** division is achieved by multiplication and inversion:\
(example: ` > X is Y breeding like the literal opposite of Z times` = `X=Y*1/Z`= `X=Y/Z`)

## brackets
In GTL `(` and `)` are used to group expressions in a standard way.\

## Order of operations
Standard order of operations is used in mathematical expressions.
1. Brackets `()`
2. Unary properties:
   - `flipped`
   - `the literal opposite of`
3. Multiplicative operations:
   - `breeding like Y times`
   - `whatever left from Y`
4. Additive operations:
   - `joined by Y`
5. Comparison operations:
   - `beats`, `beaten by`, `vibe with`, `doesn't vibe with`, `unbeaten by`, `doesn't beat`
6. Logical NOT:
   - `not`
7. Logical AND:
   - `also`
8. Logical OR:
   - `alternatively`

Operators at the same precedence level are evaluated left-to-right.
