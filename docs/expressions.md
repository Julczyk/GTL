# expressions


- `:c` := false
- `c:` := true

- addition: `>X joined by Y` - `X+=Y`
- multiplication: `>X breeing like Y times` - `X*=Y` (Might be hard to implement since keyword 'like' is used elsewhere)
- negation: `the literal opposite of`
(example: `>X joined by the literal opposite of Y` = `X-=Y`)
- modulo: `X but whatever is left from Y` = `X = X%Y`
