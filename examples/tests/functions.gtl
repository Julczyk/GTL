FUNCTIONS:
 > spit "FUNCTIONS:"
 > be example1 # define function
 > seeing x  # return value
 > likes seeing anon  # argument
 > x is anon
 > profit
 >
 > be example2
 > seeing x is 15 # default return value
 > profit
 >
 > see x is calling example1 regarding 5
 > spit "x1: " joined by x
 > x is calling example2
 > spit "x2: " joined by x
Overloading:
This is function for adding int
 > spit "\nOVERLOADING:"
 > be fooi
 > seeing ret
 > likes seeing anon
 > spit "I am int function"
 > ret is anon joined by 2
 > profit

This is same function, but for double
 > be fooi
 > tasting ret
 > likes tasting anon
 > spit "I am double function"
 > ret is anon joined by 2.2
 > profit

Test it
 > see anna is 2
 > anna is calling fooi regarding anna
 > spit "anna int is: " joined by anna
 > taste bob is 2
 > bob is calling fooi regarding bob
 > spit "bob double is: " joined by bob
    > call fooi regarding "ee" # error, func(string) does not exist

RECURSION:
 > spit "\nRECURSION:"
This is recursive implementation of classic factorial function defined over non-negative integers
 > be factorial
 > seeing colleague is 1
 > likes seeing level
 > spit "Hi! We are currently on level " joined by level joined by " in our recursive function"
 > implying level beats 1
 > colleague is calling factorial regarding level joined by the literal opposite of 1
 > colleague is breeding like level times
 > or sth
 > profit
 >
 > see absolute_unit is calling factorial regarding 10
 > spit "factorial of 10: " joined by absolute_unit

RECURSION IN SUB FUNCTION:
 > spit "\nRECURSION IN SUB FUNCTION:"
 > be gay
 > likes seeing man
 >   be straight
 >      likes seeing woman
 >      woman devolves
 >      spit woman
 >      implying woman beats 0
 >          call straight regarding woman
 >      or sth
 >   profit
 > call straight regarding man
 > profit
 >
 > call gay regarding 10 #correct
    > call gay regarding 250 # error, stack overflow
